# 05 – Repurposing & Automation System

This module ensures one piece of content is reused across platforms
with minimum effort and future automation readiness.

---

## CORE IDEA

Create once.
Reuse everywhere.
Automate later.

---

## REPURPOSING FLOW (MANUAL → AUTOMATED)

Original Content:
- Instagram Reel (Primary)

Repurposed Into:
- YouTube Short
- Telegram Post
- Carousel
- PDF content
- Future email/newsletter

---

## DAILY REPURPOSING CHECKLIST

After creating 1 Reel:

1. Export Reel video
2. Upload same video to YouTube Shorts
3. Copy caption text → Telegram
4. Extract points → Carousel slides
5. Save script → PDF folder

Never create new content for each platform.

---

## FILE STORAGE STRUCTURE (LOCAL / DRIVE)

/content-assets
  /reels
  /shorts
  /captions
  /carousels
  /pdfs

This structure must be followed for automation.

---

## AUTOMATION READY RULES

- Same naming convention for files
- Same folder structure always
- Same content flow daily

This allows tools like n8n / Zapier later.

---

## FUTURE AUTOMATION IDEAS (DO NOT BUILD NOW)

- Auto upload reels to Shorts
- Auto post captions to Telegram
- Auto save scripts to Drive
- Auto analytics collection

Focus now: MANUAL consistency.

---

## GOLDEN RULES

- Repurpose > Create new
- Manual first, automate later
- System first, tools later

Automation without system = chaos.
