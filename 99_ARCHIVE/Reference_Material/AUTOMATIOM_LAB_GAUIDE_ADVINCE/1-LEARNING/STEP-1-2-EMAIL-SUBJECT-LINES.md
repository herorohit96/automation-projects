## 💡 PRO TIPS

**Tip 1: Avoid Spam Words**
❌ Don't use: "FREE", "GUARANTEED", "URGENT!!!!"
✅ Use instead: "Limited slots", "Price expires", "Only 10 left"

**Tip 2: Keep It Short**
- Mobile: 30-40 characters max
- Desktop: 50-60 characters

**Tip 3: Curiosity Gap**
- Setup without complete answer
- Make them open email to find out

**Tip 4: Test Emoji**
- Email: "⏰ The ₹7,999 price is gone in 6 hours" = Higher open
- But don't use too many (1 emoji max)

**Tip 5: Personalization**
- "Hey [Name], here's..." = Higher open than generic
- Most email tools support this

## BONUS: IF YOU'RE GETTING LOW OPEN RATES

**Check these:**
1. Is your list engaged? (old list = low open)
2. Are you emailing at right time? (8-10 AM, 6-8 PM best)
3. Is your "from" name trusted? (personal name > company name)
4. Are you in spam folder? (check deliverability)

**Fix:**
- Re-engage old list (send "Still interested?" email)
- Change sending time (test 9 AM vs 6 PM)
- Use your real name instead of brand
- Add authentication (SPF, DKIM records)
