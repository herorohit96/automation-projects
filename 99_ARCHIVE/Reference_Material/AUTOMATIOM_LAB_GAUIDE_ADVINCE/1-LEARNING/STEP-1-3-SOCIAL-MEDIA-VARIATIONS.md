## POST VARIATION 1: AFFILIATE BOT - RESULTS-BASED

### Twitter/X Version (280 characters)
```
Just made ₹50K posting Telegram deals automatically.

0 hours of work.
0 new ideas.
Just setup the bot once.

Now it runs 24/7 while I sleep.

Here's the template: [link]

### LinkedIn Version (500+ characters)
```
Day 1: Confused how to automate affiliate marketing
Day 7: First ₹5,000 earned
Day 30: ₹50,000 in 30 days

What changed? I stopped doing things manually.

I built an automation bot that:
✅ Fetches deals automatically
✅ Posts to Telegram on schedule
✅ Tracks conversions in real-time
✅ Calculates earnings daily

Now I'm earning ₹100K+ monthly. Passive. Automated. Scalable.

The template I built is now available for anyone who wants this.

## POST VARIATION 3: AFFILIATE BOT - QUICK TIPS

### Twitter Threads (5 tweets)
```
THREAD: How to earn ₹100K/month with affiliate automation

🧵

1/ Most affiliate marketers make ₹0-5K/month because they're manual.

Posting deals one by one.
Tracking conversions manually.
Calculating commission by hand.

It's exhausting. And inefficient.

2/ What if instead of posting manually, your bot did it?

100+ posts/day
Automatic conversion tracking
Daily earnings report
All while you sleep

That's the power of automation.

3/ How does it work?

Bot fetches deals from 20+ sources (Amazon, Flipkart, etc)
Posts to your Telegram channel automatically
Tracks clicks and conversions
Calculates your earnings

Zero effort. 100% passive.

4/ Results I saw:

Week 1: ₹2,000
Week 2: ₹8,000
Week 3: ₹15,000
Week 4: ₹25,000

Month 1: ₹50,000

And that was just 1 channel. I now run 5.

5/ Want to do this?

I packaged the exact template I use.
It's available now.
Link below.
₹7,999 one-time.

**👉 ACTION: Post 1 thread per week on Twitter.**

## POST VARIATION 4: AFFILIATE BOT - TESTIMONIAL STYLE

### LinkedIn Testimonial Post
```
"This template paid for itself in 3 days."
— Rohan, Affiliate Marketer

Last week, Rohan told me he made ₹50K in his first month using my affiliate bot template.

He was skeptical at first.

"Will this really work?"
"Is this a scam?"
"Can a beginner do this?"

All valid questions.

Then he tried it.

Day 1: Imported workflow
Day 2: Got first conversions
Day 7: ₹5,000 earned

Now he's running 5 channels. ₹100K+/month.

The moral? Automation works.

Templates work.

**👉 ACTION: Create 1 testimonial post per week. Ask customers permission first.**

## POST VARIATION 5: AFFILIATE BOT - FEAR-BASED (FOMO)

### Twitter
```
Your competitor just made ₹1000 today.

Posting affiliate deals.
Automatically.
While sleeping.

You're still doing it manually.

That's the only difference between you two.

Here's the template they use: [link]

#automation
```

### Instagram Caption
```
Everyone's doing automation. Everyone except you.

Your feed: Manual posts
Their feed: 100+ automated posts

Your earnings: ₹0-1K/month
Their earnings: ₹50K+/month

Same opportunity. Different approach.

The template is in bio. 

#NotYourCompetitorAnymore
