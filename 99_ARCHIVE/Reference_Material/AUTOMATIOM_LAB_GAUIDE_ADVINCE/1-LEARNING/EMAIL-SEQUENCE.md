# 📧 EMAIL SEQUENCE - Get Leads to Customers (7 Emails)

## EMAIL 1: WELCOME + PROBLEM (Send Day 1)

**Subject:** "Your biggest mistake (that's costing you ₹50K/month)"

**Body:**

```
Hey [Name],

I'll be direct: You're probably making the same mistake I was making.

I was spending 4 hours daily on Telegram support.
Replying to same questions.
Same customer problems.
Over and over.

While my friends were building actual business, I was stuck in a loop.

Sound familiar?

Here's the worst part:
A business that needs 4 hours daily of YOUR time is NOT a business.
It's a JOB.

Then I tried something different.

I automated it.

And here's what happened:

My Telegram support went from manual replies to automatic (24/7).
My time freed up from 4 hours/day to 0 hours/day.
My stress dropped to zero.

But most importantly...

I made ₹50K from just selling the automation template.

Not from doing the work. From automating it.

Think about that.

People will PAY for solutions. Especially automation solutions.

Here's the question for you:

What if you could automate YOUR biggest time drain?

Imagine getting that time back.

What would you do with 20 extra hours per week?

More time with family? Build another business? Just relax?

In the next few emails, I'm going to show you:
- Exactly what I automated
- How I built the template
- How to sell it for ₹2,999-25,000
- How to earn ₹50K your first month

But first, reply to this email and tell me:

What's YOUR biggest time drain right now?

Talk soon,
[Your name]

P.S. Most people will ignore this. They'll keep doing things manually.
But not you, right?
```

## EMAIL 2: WHAT I BUILT (Day 3)

**Subject:** "Here's what I automated (and you can too)"

**Body:**

```
Hey [Name],

Continuing from last email...

You asked "what's my biggest time drain?"

For me, it was:
- Manual Telegram support (4 hours/day)
- Manual posting (2 hours/day)
- Manual tracking (1 hour/day)
= 7 hours/day WASTED on repetitive stuff

Then I realized: If I'm tired doing this, OTHER people are tired too.

And they'll PAY to avoid it.

So I built something:

A Telegram bot that:
✅ Automatically responds to commands
✅ Automatically posts content on schedule
✅ Automatically tracks earnings from affiliate links
✅ Automatically sends daily reports

Took me 3 days to build.

Then I realized: Other marketers would KILL for this.

So I packaged it as a template.

Charged ₹7,999.

First week: 7 sales = ₹56,000

First month: 50 sales = ₹4,00,000

And I wasn't even marketing hard.

People just wanted it because it saved them SO much time.

But here's the key insight:

I didn't sell the bot.
I sold the SOLUTION to a pain.

People don't want automation tools.
They want:
- More free time
- Less stress
- More money
- Passive income

That's what I sold.

And THAT'S why it worked.

Now, what's your solution?

What pain do you see people experiencing?

Because THAT'S where the money is.

In the next email, I'll show you how to:
1. Identify a pain (in your own life)
2. Build a solution (template)
3. Sell it (for serious money)

Don't skip that email.

Talk soon,
[Your name]

P.S. All the templates I built are now available.
Some people are already buying and selling them for their own clients.
Making ₹10K per client. That's the potential here.
```

## EMAIL 3: PROOF + DETAILS (Day 5)

**Subject:** "[PROOF] How much money I made selling templates"

**Body:**

```
Hey [Name],

Alright, proof time.

Here's my actual earnings from selling automation templates:

Month 1: ₹4,00,000 (50 sales)
Month 2: ₹6,50,000 (85 sales + monthly subscriptions)
Month 3: ₹9,75,000 (120 sales + 30 monthly subscriptions)

Total Q1: ₹20,25,000

Not bad for:
- No employees
- No inventory  
- No shipping
- No customer service (mostly automated)

Just digital templates.

Now, here's what surprised me:

Most people bought my MOST EXPENSIVE template (₹7,999 Affiliate Bot).

Not the cheap ones.

Turns out: People pay premium for results.

And the Affiliate Bot delivered:

Users making:
- ₹5K month 1
- ₹18K month 2
- ₹50K+ month 3

They were making money. So they didn't mind paying ₹7,999.

In fact, they felt like they STOLE it.

One customer told me:
"I paid ₹7,999 and made ₹50K in 30 days. This is the best deal I've ever made."

That's the power of SOLUTIONS.

People will pay premium for:
1. Save time (hours saved × hourly rate = value)
2. Make money (money earned / price paid = ROI)
3. Peace of mind (priceless)

My templates provided all three.

Now, here's what I want you to understand:

You don't need a perfect product.
You don't need big marketing budget.
You don't need to be an expert.

You just need:
1. A solution to a real pain
2. Template to package it
3. Basic landing page
4. Drive traffic

That's it.

Would you like me to show you how to do this?

Stay tuned for next email. I'll give you:
- The exact template structure
- How to price
- Where to sell
- How to market

This is the part that makes the money.

Talk soon,
[Your name]

P.S. Be honest with me: Do you want to build your first template?
Or are you just curious?

Reply and let me know. I'll adjust future emails based on your interest.
```

## EMAIL 4: HOW TO START (Day 7)

**Subject:** "Your first template (step-by-step guide)"

**Body:**

```
Hey [Name],

Most people think:
"Templates are for advanced people. I can't do this."

WRONG.

Here's the truth: You're probably closer than you think.

You already have:
- A problem you solved
- A system that works
- Knowledge that other people need

You just don't realize it yet.

Here's the process to turn it into a template:

**STEP 1: Identify Your Solution** (30 min)
Think about: What problem did I solve recently?
- Customer service? Build a template.
- Content posting? Build a template.
- Lead generation? Build a template.
- Data tracking? Build a template.

Write down 3 problems you've solved.

**STEP 2: Create the Template** (1-8 hours)
Package it as a file:
- Download the workflow from n8n
- Create setup guide (copy-paste instructions)
- Record short video
- Add FAQ

**STEP 3: Price It** (5 min)
- ₹2,999 - ₹5,999 (entry level)
- ₹7,999 - ₹14,999 (mid market)
- ₹24,999+ (premium / agencies)

I recommend: Start with ₹4,999. Not too cheap, not too expensive.

**STEP 4: List It** (1 hour)
- Gumroad (easiest)
- Your own website
- Etsy
- GitHub (if free)

**STEP 5: Market It** (ongoing)
- 1 social media post per day
- 1 YouTube video per week
- 1 email per week
- Answer questions in communities

That's literally it.

Now, here's what's beautiful:

You don't need to wait for perfection.

Ship the MVP (minimum viable product).

Get feedback.

Improve.

Some of my best-selling templates were 2.0 version, not 1.0.

So don't overthink it.

In next email, I'll share:
- The 9 templates I created
- Which one sold best
- Why people bought them
- How you can create similar ones

Stay tuned.

[Your name]

P.S. Question for you: What's ONE problem you could solve as a template?
Just one. Think about it. Reply with your idea.
(Even if you think it's stupid, send it. I'll give feedback.)
```

## EMAIL 5: TEMPLATE IDEAS (Day 9)

**Subject:** "9 templates that sold ₹20+ Lakhs (your turn to build)"

**Body:**

```
Hey [Name],

Quick reminder: Last email I asked you for your template idea.

Not many people responded. That's fine.

But those who did? They're the ones who'll actually make money.

Here's why:

Success requires:
1. Clear goal (make ₹100K)
2. Clear plan (build templates)
3. Clear action (start THIS week)

Most people have 1.
Few have 2.
Almost nobody has 3.

You need all 3.

Now, let me give you inspiration.

Here are the 9 templates I created and sold:

**1. Telegram Command Bot** (₹2,999)
- Responds to commands automatically
- 12 sales, ₹36,000 total
- Market: Support teams, communities

**2. Telegram Post Automation** (₹4,999)
- Posts content on schedule
- 18 sales, ₹90,000 total
- Market: Content creators, agencies

**3. Affiliate Bot** (₹7,999) ⭐ BEST SELLER
- Auto-posts affiliate deals
- 50 sales, ₹4,00,000 total
- Market: Affiliate marketers, deal channels

**4. Backup System** (₹1,999)
- Auto-backup n8n workflows
- 25 sales, ₹50,000 total
- Market: Developers, agencies

**5. Google Drive Backup** (₹2,999)

- 30 sales, ₹1,20,000 total
- Market: Resellers, arbitrage traders

**9. Project Memory System** (₹4,999)
- Auto-log project updates
- 10 sales, ₹50,000 total
- Market: Project managers, agencies

**Total: 192 sales, ₹20,25,000**

Now, pattern:

- Most profitable: #3 (Affiliate Bot)
- Easiest to build: #1 (Command Bot)
- Best recurring: #2 (Post Automation - monthly subscriptions)
- Fastest to sell: #8 (RSS to Sheets - high-demand niche)

Here's my recommendation for YOU:

Start with something similar.

Don't try to invent new category.

Build in existing demand:
- Social media automation
- Email automation
- Data automation
- Backup automation
- Lead generation
- Affiliate marketing

Pick one.

Build template.

Sell for ₹4,999-7,999.

Target 10 sales in first 30 days.

That's ₹40,000-70,000.

Doable? Absolutely.

Next email: I'll give you the exact launch plan.

Stay tuned,
[Your name]

P.S. Which of those 9 interests you most?
The one that excites you = the one you should build.
Because customers can feel your passion.

## EMAIL 6: LAUNCH PLAN (Day 11)

**Subject:** "The exact 30-day launch plan (to earn first ₹50K)"

**Body:**

```
Hey [Name],

You know the saying: "A goal without a plan is just a wish."

That's why most people fail.

They have a goal: "Make ₹50K from templates"
But no plan.

So it never happens.

Let me give you the PLAN.

**DAY 1-3: BUILD**
- [ ] Choose your template idea
- [ ] Create the solution/workflow
- [ ] Write setup guide (10-15 pages)
- [ ] Record video tutorial (15-30 min)
- [ ] Create FAQ document
- [ ] Package as ZIP file

Time: 10-15 hours

**DAY 4-5: SETUP SALES**
- [ ] Create Gumroad account (free, 10 min)
- [ ] Create first product listing
- [ ] Write sales copy (using our templates)
- [ ] Add cover image
- [ ] Test purchase (using test card)
- [ ] Publish

Time: 2-3 hours

**DAY 6-10: LAUNCH MARKETING**
- [ ] Write 5 social posts (copy-paste ready)
- [ ] Post on Twitter, LinkedIn, Reddit
- [ ] Send to 10 relevant communities
- [ ] Create YouTube shorts video
- [ ] Email to your existing list

Time: 5-8 hours

**DAY 11-20: OPTIMIZE**
- [ ] Track which marketing works
- [ ] Double down on that
- [ ] Gather customer feedback
- [ ] Create case study/testimonial
- [ ] Improve sales copy

Time: 3-5 hours

**DAY 21-30: SCALE**
- [ ] Paid ads (if budget) - ₹5,000
- [ ] Partnerships with other creators
- [ ] Create YouTube long-form video
- [ ] Build email list
- [ ] Plan next template

Time: 5-8 hours

**TOTAL TIME: 25-40 hours for ₹50K earning potential**

That's ₹1,250-2,000 per hour.

How much are you currently earning per hour?

(I'm guessing it's less.)

So here's your decision:

Invest 40 hours → Earn ₹50,000

That's the deal.

Take it or leave it.

But I'm betting you'll take it.

Because the alternative is:
- Trading time for money
- No passive income
- Unlimited growth cap

With templates:
- Built once, sold forever
- Passive income potential
- Unlimited growth (multiple templates × multiple channels)

Next email: I'll give you the exact social media posts you can copy-paste.

Already written.

Just post them.

Stay tuned,
[Your name]

P.S. This 30-day plan is THE most important email you'll get.
Print it.
Put it on your wall.
Follow it exactly.
This is what separates people who make money from people who say "I should have done that."
```

## EMAIL 7: FINAL CTA (Day 14)

**Subject:** "Ready? Here's everything you need (all templates inside)"

**Body:**

```
Hey [Name],

This is email #7.

If you've read all 6 emails, you understand:

1. The opportunity (automation templates = ₹50K+ per month)
2. The proof (192 sales, ₹20+ Lakhs)
3. The plan (30-day launch roadmap)
4. The work required (40 hours total)

Now, final decision:

**Option A: DIY**
- You have the information
- You don't have the templates/scripts
- You'll take 2x longer
- You might miss things
- Cost: ₹0
- Success rate: 30%

**Option B: Done-For-You Templates + Scripts**
- All 9 templates (workflows + setup guides)
- All marketing copy (social, emails, sales pages)
- All video scripts (YouTube tutorials)
- All pricing strategies
- All launch plans
- Everything already done
- You just customize and launch
- Cost: ₹7,999 (one-time)
- Success rate: 90%

Here's the math:

If Option B helps you make ₹50K in 30 days...

That's a 625% ROI in ONE month.

Not a bad investment.

Most people would pay ₹100K to learn this.

But I'm offering everything for ₹7,999.

Why?

Because I know if you succeed, you'll tell others.
