## PART 13: AUTOMATED UPLOAD OPTION (rclone)

If you want to upload the entire `C:\automation-lab` to Google Drive from PowerShell, use `rclone`.

### Install & configure rclone (PowerShell):

```powershell
# Download and unzip rclone (one-time)
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://downloads.rclone.org/rclone-current-windows-amd64.zip" -OutFile "$env:USERPROFILE\Downloads\rclone.zip"
Expand-Archive -Path "$env:USERPROFILE\Downloads\rclone.zip" -DestinationPath "$env:USERPROFILE\Downloads\rclone"
# Move rclone.exe to a PATH folder (runs as admin)
Move-Item -Path "$env:USERPROFILE\Downloads\rclone\rclone-*-windows-amd64\rclone.exe" -Destination "C:\Windows\System32\rclone.exe"
```

Then configure Google Drive remote:

```powershell
rclone config
# Follow prompts: n (new remote) → name: gdrive → storage: drive
# It will open browser to authenticate Google account
```

Upload folder to Drive:

```powershell
# Copy local folder to Drive folder named 'Automation Business'
rclone copy "C:\automation-lab" gdrive:"Automation Business" --progress
```

---

## FINAL NOTES

- Main deliverable created in this repo: place all files under `C:\automation-lab` then upload to Drive.
- After upload, use Linktree/Carrd for a simple public page linking to Gumroad, Fiverr, Upwork, and the portfolio PDF.
- I added a task list to track progress; tell me which item to start and I'll act on it.

---

If you allow, I can now: 
- Upload local files to Google Drive using `rclone` (I will provide commands and a one-time `rclone config` flow), or
- Create the Linktree/Carrd landing HTML (ready to paste), or
- Draft the exact Fiverr gig (ready to paste).

Tell me which one to do next.
