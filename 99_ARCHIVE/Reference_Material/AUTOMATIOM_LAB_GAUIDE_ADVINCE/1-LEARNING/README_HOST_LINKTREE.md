Do this to publish the `LINKTREE-CARRD-LANDING.html` created earlier.

Option A — Carrd (recommended, easiest)
1. Go to https://carrd.co and signup.
2. Create a new site and choose blank.
3. Add an "Embed" element and paste the HTML from `LINKTREE-CARRD-LANDING.html` or upload as "Code".
4. Publish and set a custom domain if you want.

Option B — GitHub Pages (free, needs Git)
1. Create a new GitHub repo (public or gh-pages branch).
2. Copy `LINKTREE-CARRD-LANDING.html` into repo as `index.html`.
3. Push to GitHub.
4. In repo -> Settings -> Pages -> set source to `main` branch / root.
5. Wait a few minutes; your page will be at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo>`.

Option C — Static host (Netlify/Vercel)
1. Sign up to Netlify (https://app.netlify.com).
2. Drag & drop the `LINKTREE-CARRD-LANDING.html` file onto Sites -> New site from Git or from drag-drop.
3. Publish.

Notes:
- Update the placeholder links in `LINKTREE-CARRD-LANDING.html` before publishing.
- For Carrd, easier to edit links from the UI.

If you want, main HTML ko aapke GitHub repo me push kar doon — bolo repo name aur main branch use karna hai ya nahi.
