## LINKEDIN POST 1
```
"Passive income through automation"

As a freelancer, I noticed a pattern:
- Businesses waste hours on repetitive tasks
- They'll pay for solutions
- Automation is the solution

So I built 9 templates and sold them for ₹4K-25K each.

In 90 days: ₹3+ Lakhs in sales.

This can be you. No advanced coding needed.

Key insight: Automation = Income. Not optional. Necessary.

Subject: I just earned ₹50K (here's how)

Hey [Name],

Remember I was stressed about freelance work?

Last month I switched to selling automation templates.

9 templates. 3 months. ₹3+ Lakhs.

The best part? I work 2 hours/day now.

Here's what I learned:

1. People WILL pay for solutions
2. My first sale came in 2 days
3. Affiliate bot is the goldmine

I'm opening access to my templates this weekend.

Early bird: ₹2,999 (regular ₹7,999)

Interested?

Made ₹100K in first month - here's the exact tool

Been selling on Amazon for 2 years. Made decent money but manual.

So I built an automation bot that:
- Scrapes deals from 20 sources

- Tracks clicks
- Shows earnings per link

First month: 50 customers. ₹100K revenue.

Now selling the template for ₹7,999.
