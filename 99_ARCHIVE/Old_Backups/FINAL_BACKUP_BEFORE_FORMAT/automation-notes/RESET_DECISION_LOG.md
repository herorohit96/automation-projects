# RESET DECISION LOG 🔥

Date: Today
Decision: FULL RESET – Fresh Start

Reason:
- Docker Desktop not opening consistently
- WSL + Docker conflict suspected
- Old setup not critical or production-level
- Time is more valuable than debugging

What I am doing:
- Removing Docker Desktop completely
- Removing old n8n data and experiments
- Restarting with clean Docker-only n8n
- Simple + stable automation focus

Rules going forward:
- No unnecessary experiments
- One working n8n instance only
- Regular backups
- Documentation first, automation second

Mindset:
"I rebuild better, faster, and cleaner."
