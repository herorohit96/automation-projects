# N8N Control Center

## What is this?

This is your single place to control and plan your n8n automation system. N8n is a tool that helps you build workflows to automate tasks.

## Current System Status

Right now, Docker Desktop and WSL are not working well on your Windows computer. This means we cannot run n8n yet. But that's okay! We are preparing everything so that when Docker works, we can start n8n quickly and safely.

## Why Prepare Offline-First?

- We write down all plans and commands before trying them.
- This way, we avoid mistakes and can fix problems easily.
- Even if Docker does not work today, we have a clear plan for tomorrow.

## How This System Will Work Once Docker Runs

1. We will use Docker to run n8n in a safe container.
2. N8n will run on your computer and you can access it through a web browser.
3. We will save all your workflows and data in special folders called volumes.
4. We will make backups regularly to keep your work safe.
5. Every action will be logged so you can see what happened and why.
